# PyGOMAS Agent Repository

Welcome to the repository for PyGOMAS agents! This repository contains AgentSpeak code files (.asl) for programming intelligent agents to participate in games simulated using PyGOMAS (Game-Oriented Multi-Agent System based on Python).

## Objective

The objective of the agents in this repository is to survive and compete in two distinct game modes. In **Survival** Mode, agents must survive on a map populated with other agents, with health and ammo packs generated by invincible medics and field ops. In **Capture the Flag** Mode, one agent defends their flag while another attempts to steal the opponent's flag and return it to their base. Both modes offer unique challenges and require different strategies for success.

## Getting Started

To use these agents in a PyGOMAS game, follow these steps:

1. **Install PyGOMAS and its dependencies:** Follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://github.com/javipalanca/pygomas) to install PyGOMAS and its dependencies on your system.

2. **Install an XMPP server:** Install and configure an XMPP server for communication between agents. You can use any XMPP server of your choice.

3. **Launch the manager:** Launch the manager responsible for managing the game session. This can usually be done by running a specific script or command provided by PyGOMAS.

4. **Start the game:** Launch the game session with the configured agents, map settings, and game parameters.

5. **Visualize the game:** Use PyGOMAS's visualization tools to observe the game session in real-time. You can visualize the game in both 2D and 3D modes.

## Agent Files

The agent files in this repository are written in the AgentSpeak language (.asl). Each file represents the behavior and strategy of an individual agent (or a group of agents) in the game. You can browse through the files to understand different strategies and customize them according to your needs.
