# PyGOMAS Agent Repository

Welcome to the repository for PyGOMAS agents! This repository contains AgentSpeak code files (.asl) for programming intelligent agents to participate in games simulated using PyGOMAS (Game-Oriented Multi-Agent System based on Python).

## Objective

The objective of the agents in this repository is to survive in a map populated with other agents, where medics and fieldops generate health and ammo packs infinitely at the center.

## Getting Started

To use these agents in a PyGOMAS game, follow these steps:

1. **Install PyGOMAS and its dependencies:** Follow the instructions in the [official documentation](https://github.com/javipalanca/pygomas) to install PyGOMAS and its dependencies on your system.

2. **Install an XMPP server:** Install and configure an XMPP server for communication between agents. You can use any XMPP server of your choice.

3. **Launch the manager:** Launch the manager responsible for managing the game session. This can usually be done by running a specific script or command provided by PyGOMAS.

4. **Start the game:** Launch the game session with the configured agents, map settings, and game parameters.

5. **Visualize the game:** Use PyGOMAS's visualization tools to observe the game session in real-time. You can visualize the game in both 2D and 3D modes.

## Agent Files

The agent files in this repository are written in the AgentSpeak language (.asl). Each file represents the behavior and strategy of an individual agent in the game. You can browse through the files to understand different strategies and customize them according to your needs.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented new and innovative strategies for PyGOMAS agents or have improvements to existing agents, feel free to submit a pull request.
